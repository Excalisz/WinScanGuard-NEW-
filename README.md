# WinScanGuard 2.1 is Back with Exciting Updates!

After a year-long hiatus, we're thrilled to announce the return of WinScanGuard! ðŸŽ‰

## What's New in Version 2.1?

During this past year, we've been hard at work to make WinScanGuard even better. We've listened to your feedback and have implemented numerous improvements to enhance the overall user experience and effectiveness of our program. Some of the key updates include:

- **Faster Scans:** We've optimized the scanning process, so it's quicker than ever before.
- **Enhanced Recommendations:** Our updated recommendations are now more precise and user-friendly.
- **Command Prompt Support:** The big news is that WinScanGuard now works seamlessly via the Command Prompt (cmd). You can run scans and resolve issues without even opening the graphical interface.

## Running WinScanGuard via Command Prompt (cmd)

We understand that some users prefer the flexibility and control offered by the Command Prompt. With WinScanGuard 2.1, you can now use WinScanGuard directly from your cmd. Simply follow these steps:

1. Open *Run_WinScanGuard v.2.1*
2. A Command Prompt will open
3. Press Enter to start the scan
4. And wait for some minutes
5. WinScanGuard will perform a scan, and you'll receive detailed results and recommendations directly in your Results folder!
